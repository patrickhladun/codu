# üî• Exclusive Preview: Our New AI Conference + Dev Tool Updates

This is one of the busiest weeks I've had in a long time...

I usually write articles daily, but I haven't in just over a week. I have a good excuse.

I will launch **two big new projects this week** and do my first Hyrox event.

### Project 1

I'm starting a new conference called **[AI Crush](https://www.crushconf.com/)** (and it will be in Belfast next year), which will have two tracks: one for developers and one for leadership working in AI.

This is not another BS event asking, "Will AI change things?" It's a conference all about solving problems with AI. We aim to make it the most practical AI conference in the world.

Join the site's waitlist to be notified when the early bird tickets go on sale. I'll also send out our CFP in the coming days and officially announce the conference, but since you are on my friends list, you have a sneak peek. üòâ

### Project 2

**I've built a community events app.** It's not launched yet (but it will be later this week).

But **I need help!** If you or anyone you know organizes events on Meetup or Eventbrite, would you be willing to connect us?

I want to get some people to test our new events app and give us feedback.\
I'd love to chat if you have any questions or anything related to the above, so reply to this email. Now, back to our usual program:

## üìñ Book of the Week

**[The Art of Explanation](https://amzn.to/4eqAw83)**

Communication is one of those things that I think holds a lot of people back in their careers. Ros Atkins' "The Art of Explanation" is an invaluable resource for developers looking to sharpen their communication skills. Drawing from his experience as a BBC journalist known for viral video explanations of complex topics, Atkins offers a practical framework for breaking down and conveying complicated ideas.

His approach to stripping away unnecessary complexity while maintaining accuracy resonates strongly with good coding practices - it's like refactoring but for communication. The book's insights on establishing context and anticipating audience questions are handy for technical documentation and team presentations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Something Cool

**[The Craft of UI](https://craftofui.substack.com/p/building-a-drawer)**

A friend of Cod√∫, [Jhey](https://x.com/jh3yy) is one of the most creative and impressive devs out there. He's launched a new newsletter called "The Craft of UI." The article I linked is a free preview of what to expect, but for the good stuff, you gotta pay.
